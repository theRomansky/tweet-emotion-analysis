# Tweet Emotion Classification Project

## Overview
Welcome to my pet project for classifying tweets into six categories based on their emotional content. This project is still a work in progress, but I've structured it to give you an understanding of its components and stages of development.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following components:

### Notebooks
- **data_loading_and_preprocessing.ipynb**: This notebook focuses on loading and preprocessing the data for analysis.
- **text_embedding.ipynb**: Here, I use Word2Vec to represent tweets as vectors.
- **dance_model_with_emb_text.ipynb**: In this notebook, I implement a fully connected model for classification using text embeddings.
- **lstm.ipynb**: This notebook contains an LSTM model.
