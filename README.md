# Tweet Emotion Classification Project

## Overview
Welcome to my pet project for classifying tweets into six categories based on their emotional content. This project is still a work in progress, but I've structured it to give you an understanding of its components and stages of development.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following components:

### Notebooks
- **data_loading_and_preprocessing.ipynb**: This notebook focuses on loading and preprocessing the data for analysis.
- **text_embedding.ipynb**: Here, I use Word2Vec to represent tweets as vectors.
- **dance_model_with_emb_text.ipynb**: In this notebook, I implement a fully connected model for classification using text embeddings.
- **lstm.ipynb**: This notebook contains an LSTM model.

## Work in Progress
Please note that this project is not yet complete, and I'm actively working on refining the models and improving classification accuracy. Feel free to explore the notebooks and provide feedback or suggestions for improvement.

## Feedback
Your feedback is highly appreciated! If you have any questions, suggestions, or contributions, please feel free to reach out.

Feel free to customize it further to fit your project's specific details and requirements!
